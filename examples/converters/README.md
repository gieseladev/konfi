# Converters

This example demonstrates how you can add your own converters so that 
you can specify more complex types in the config.


## Optional Dependencies

This example uses `geopy` which you may install using `pip install geopy`
to display the address of the location specified in the
[config.toml](config.toml) file. However this is completely optional and
doesn't add **anything** to the example.
